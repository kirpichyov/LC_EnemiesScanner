# Enemies Scanner v1.0.2
### Adds shop item that allows to scan the nearby enemies

### Configuration
* Enable scanner ping sound (enable/disable)
* Count of the nearest enemies shown (from 1 to 8)
* Enable/Disable scan filtering by outside enemies (enable/disable)
> You can use the Thunderstore to configure the mode. Configuration files are generated after launching the game, with the mod installed, at least once.

### Known issues
- Sometimes scanned enemies are not refreshed after going inside and outside the factory. It happens when game doesn't update the corresponding property for scanner object position.
> **Workaround**: change current selected slot to other one and switch back. If it doesn't help try to turn off and drop the scanner, then equip it again. Also, you could enable the 'Disable filtering by outside enemies' feature in the config if needed.
